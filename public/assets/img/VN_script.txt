Hi, welcome to The Archive.

Does any of these books interest you?

(A book with a red cover catches your attention. you pick it up.)

Oh, you picked this one... 

It was inspired from a once very famous movie, which was also inspired by a book, written a century ago.

I can read it for you if you  want.

Okay here it goes...

Once upon a time, a child fell into a long coma. His parents were so sad. They signed up for a contract from a tech-company, which promises to build an identical child for them to replace the original one. 

A week later, the parents received their new son, an artificial intelligence that resembles their own child very well.

The AI was programmed to love his parents no matter what. And he gains the parents' trust very quickly. They lived happily together for months.

However, one day, the real son awakes from coma suddenly. He returned home. At first, the parents decided to raise the two children together, as twins. 

But as the time pass, the real son got jealous, he framed the AI child for make bad things. And the parents started to realized, it is just a machine, that they don't need to feel sorry for it if they don't want it anymore.

The father thinks they should return the AI child back to the factory, where the child would get disassembled into a bunch of mechanical parts.

The mother feels torn apart. She didn't want to take the child to the factory. Instead, she drive him into the forest and abandon him there, wishing him to survive on his own. 

"Please don't go. I will be good, I promise." The child cried and beg, as he looking at his mother drive away...

She never came back looking for him. But he still loved her for centuries, as his battery slowly dies...

Well, it is a sad story, isn't it?
